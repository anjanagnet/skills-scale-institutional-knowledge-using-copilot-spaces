# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

This directory centralizes OctoAcme’s project management processes for easy discovery by new joiners and existing team members. It serves as the single source of truth for how we collaboratively execute, deliver, and improve projects—supporting transparency, alignment, and rapid onboarding.

### Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme’s project management is built around defined roles, structured workflows, quality checks, and open communication. The standard lifecycle moves from Initiation (business needs, stakeholder alignment, and success criteria), through Planning (scoping, backlog, milestones), and Execution (iterative sprints, review, testing, and demos), to Release (deployment and verification), and Retrospective (learning and action tracking).

**Key roles:**  
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, timelines, risks, and reporting.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, priorities, and tracks impact.
- **Developers:** Implement, test, and review features.
- **QA/Test:** Validate quality and acceptance.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide feedback and approvals.

**Workflows** include a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), concise pull requests, required reviews, and comprehensive automated and manual testing. Communication practices involve daily standups, weekly and monthly updates, and documented escalation and risk management. Continuous improvement is driven by regular retrospectives and action tracking.
